Providing low-interest loans to small-scale farmers could lead to increased competition and potentially drive down food prices, making it more difficult for farmers to make a profit.There is also the risk that these loans may not be used effectively, or that farmers may not be able to repay them, leading to further financial difficulties.
Providing low-interest loans to small-scale farmers could help to improve their ability to produce and sell food, which could in turn help to reduce poverty in their communities. This could also help to improve food security by increasing the amount of food produced locally, rather than relying on imports.
Not taking a stance on the matter is not acceptable in any way. We need to make a decition on matters that come to us.
