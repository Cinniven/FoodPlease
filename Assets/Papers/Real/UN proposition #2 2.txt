Providing emergency food assistance to civilians affected by civil wars could be expensive and may not be sustainable in the long term, particularly if the conflicts continue or escalate. There is also the risk that emergency food assistance may not be distributed effectively, or that it may not reach those in need in a timely manner.
Providing emergency food assistance to civilians affected by civil wars could help to reduce hunger and malnutrition in these areas, improving the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities.This could also help to support local agriculture and the economy by providing a source of income and resources for recovery. 
Not taking a stance on the matter is not acceptable in any way. We need to make a decition on matters that come to us.
