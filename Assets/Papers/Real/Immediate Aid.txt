Immediate aid may not address the underlying causes of food insecurity, such as poverty, lack of access to education and healthcare, and environmental degradation. On top of that it can create dependency, and it may not be sustainable in the long term.
Immediate Aid was likely to be less expensive and could provide relief to people suffering from hunger in the short term. But providing immediate aid could have been an effective way to save lives and prevent malnutrition and other health problems associated with hunger.
Not taking a stance on the matter of disaster relief fund is not acceptable in any way. We need to make a decition on matters that come to us.
