Implementing a program to support peace and reconciliation efforts in countries affected by civil wars could be expensive and time-consuming, particularly if it involves mediation, negotiation, and other forms of intervention.There is also the risk that these efforts may not be successful in ending the conflicts and improving food security, or that they may not be sustainable in the long term.
Supporting peace and reconciliation efforts in countries affected by civil wars could help to end the conflicts and create conditions that are more conducive to food security and the reduction of hunger. This could also help to support local agriculture and the economy by enabling the production and distribution of food and other goods, and by facilitating trade and commerce.
Not taking a stance on the matter of disaster relief fund is not acceptable in any way. We need to make a decition on matters that come to us.
