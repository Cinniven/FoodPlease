UN proposition #1
The UN proposes implementing a disaster relief fund to provide emergency food assistance to communities affected by natural disasters.

About the disaster relief fund, implementing it could be expensive and may not be sustainable in the long term, particularly if natural disasters become more frequent or severe.
Emergency transportation and logistics support could have helped to quickly and effectively distribute food and improving food security in disaster areas. This could also help to support local agriculture and the economy by enabling the distribution of locally-produced food and other goods.
Not taking a stance on the matter of disaster relief fund is not acceptable in any way. We need to make a decition on matters that come to us.
